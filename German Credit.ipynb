    "## Project Overview\n",
    "In consumer lending, credit risk assessment plays a critical role in minimizing financial losses and ensuring sustainable portfolio growth. Banks must evaluate whether a loan applicant is likely to repay their debt based on personal, financial, and credit-related characteristics.\n",
    "This project uses the German Credit dataset to analyze borrower behavior and identify factors associated with high-risk (default-prone) customers.\n",
    "### Project Objective\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to:\n",
    "- Identify borrower profiles that are most likely to be classified as high credit risk\n",
    "- Understand the key drivers of credit risk using interpretable models\n",
    "- Provide actionable recommendations for banks to reduce potential bad debt"
