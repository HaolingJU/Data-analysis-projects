    "## 1. Analysis Background\n",
    "The dataset comes from an e-commerce website that conducted an A/B test to compare an old landing page with a new version.\n",
    "The objective is to determine whether the new page leads to a statistically significant improvement in user conversion rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data Overview\n",
    "- Dataset size: **294,478 rows**\n",
    "- Columns:\n",
    "  - `user_id`\n",
    "  - `timestamp`\n",
    "  - `group`\n",
    "  - `landing_page`\n",
    "  - `converted`\n",

    "### 3.1 Missing Values\n",
    "- Number of rows containing any null values: **0**\n",

    "No missing value handling was required.\n",

    "### 3.2 Logical Consistency Check\n",
    "Valid combinations:\n",
    "- `control` → `old_page`\n",
    "- `treatment` → `new_page`\n",

    "### 4.2 Sampling Distribution\n",
    "- Binary outcome (converted / not converted)\n",
    "- Binomial distribution\n",
    "- Two independent samples\n",
    "- Large sample size (n > 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "A **two-sample Z-test for proportions** is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Test Direction\n",
    "Since the goal is to test whether the new page performs better, a **one-sided (right-tailed) test** is used.\n",

    "Since the p-value is smaller than the significance level (0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",

    "**There is statistically significant evidence that the new landing page has a higher conversion rate than the old page.**\n"
